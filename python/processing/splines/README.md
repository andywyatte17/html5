## MyCurve2

The code contained here shows a working demo of a curve type where points can be
supplied by the user with a flag for each denoting whether the point is a
corner or curve point. The curve is rendered using some logic that draws curved
sections using a cubic Bezier curve for curve sections and straight lines for
straight sections.

### Test Program

### draw_curves_4.py

The logic for the final draw method is contained within draw_curves_4.py.
